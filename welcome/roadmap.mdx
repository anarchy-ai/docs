## 🚧 Planned Features 🚧

**We're actively working on delivering these features**

- **Live Data Augmentation** - You will be able to provide a live updating data-set and the Anarchy LLM-VM will fine-tune your models or work with a vector DB to provide up-to-date information with citations

- **Web Playground** - You will be able to run the Anarchy LLM-VM and test it's outputs from the browser.

- **Load-Balancing and Orchestration** -- If you have multiple LLMs or providers you'd like to utilize, you will be able to hand them to the Anarchy LLM-VM to automatically figure out which to work with and when to optimize your uptime or your costs

- **Output Templating** - You can ensure that the LLM only outputs data in specific formats and fills in variables from a template with either regular expressions, LMQL, or OpenAI's template language

- **Persistent Stateful Memory** - The Anarchy LLM-VM can remember a user's conversation history and react accordingly
