title: '🤔 Why Anarchy?'
description: "We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support."

## Current Projects

- **[LLM-VM](https://anarchy.ai/welcome/llm_vm)** The LLM-VM is an LLM agnostic JIT for natural language. Specifically, it uses LLMs to convert conversational natural language into a dynamic series of LLM and IO commands. You provide the underlying provider(s), actions (APIs, code-hooks) and their descriptions, data-sources (PDFs, websites...), and the LLM-VM will take care of load-balancing, fine-tuning, natural language compilation and tool-selection.

- **[chat.dev](https://chat.dev)** This is our managed hosting service for the LLM-VM. Here you can create an optimized LLM endpoint with access to your APIs and data.

## Story

Anarchy was born out of exaspiration. We'd been AI safety researchers, hackers and long-time GNU beneficiaries,  
who saw the gestalt of our domains being annexed by the fascist rhetoric of so-called "doomers" afraid 
of "long-termist" sci-fi hypotheticals.  To us, the encroachment of regulations on our self-expression 
was a far more dire threat.  We decided then to eschew such viewpoints and do what such extremists would consider 
most anarchic: give AI access to the world.

## Our promises

**1. We will move towards open-source, not away from it.**

**2. We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.**

**3. We will not judge your use-cases.** (provided it is legal)

## 💸 How will we make money? 💸

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.
