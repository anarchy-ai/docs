## The Role of AWQ 
**Activation-Aware Weight Quantization**

In traditional weight quantization, the weights are quantized independently of the data they process. In AWQ, the quantization process takes into account the actual data distribution in the activations produced by the model during inference.

Here's how:

1. Collect Activation Statistics: During a calibration phase, a subset of the data is used to collect statistics on the activations produced by the model. This involves running the model on this data and recording the range of values and the distribution of activations.
2. Searching Weight Quantization Parameters: Weights are quantized by taking the activation statistics into account. Concretely, we perform a space search for quantization paremeters (e.g., scales and zeropoints), to minimize the distortions incurred by quantization on output activations. As a result, the quantized weights can be accurately represented with fewer bits.
3. Quantizing: With the quantization parameters in place, the model weights are quantized using a reduced number of bits.

### Running REBEL
**Getting started with REBEL is easy**
```python quickstart_REBEL.py
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client
import os

# Instantiate the client specifying which LLM you want to use
client = Client(big_model='chat_gpt', small_model='gpt') #REBEL will use chat_gpt no matter what big model is specified here, this specification exists for non-REBEL completion calls. 

#Calling client.complete with a tool list specified leads to the REBEL agent being used.
response = client.complete(
	 prompt = 'Is it warmer in Paris or Timbuktu and what are the temperatures in either city?',
         context='',
         openai_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), #for REBEL we need an OpenAI key
         tools=[{'description': 'Find the weather at a location and returns it in celcius.',  #this tool list contains only one dictionary, therefore only one tool
                 'dynamic_params': {
		 		   "latitude": 'latitude of as a float',
		 		   "longitude": 'the longitude as a float'
				   },
                 'method': 'GET',
                 'url': "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast",
                 'static_params': {'current_weather': 'true'}}]) #No tools by default, so you have to add your own
print(response)
```
### Tool Definition
Tools are defined by dictionaries that are added to the list ```tools```. These dictionaries need to contain the following fields:

|Field| Type | Description|
|-|-|-|
|```'description'```| string | A description of what the tool does|
|```'dynamic_params'```| dictionary | A dictionary containing key value pairs (paramter name : description) of the API endpoint's mutable parameters that need to be set by REBEL in order to answer a query|
|```'method'```| string | ```GET``` or ```POST```, whichever is the type of the API endpoint|
|```'url'```| string | URL of the API endpoint that the given tool specifies|
|```'static_params'```| dictionary | Any parameters that are constant between all API calls. An API key/token is an example of this|

You can add any tool you want and as many as you need. REBEL will attempt to compositionally answer a question that may require calling multiple tools.
