## The Anarchy Way

* Always be on the lookout for opportunities to be helpful.
* Have weak opinions you express strongly.
* Every side has a grain of truth (in non-technical discussions).  You just don't know everybody's language.  You're aim should be to learn.
* Be honest.
* Just do things and many things, but do them well.
* Don’t ask for permission.
* Don’t be mad if somebody does a thing  without asking permission.  Next time make sure the auths are correct.
* A product shouldn't tell somebody they can't do something, but it's okay to tell them they shouldn't.
* Code should be simple and short.
* Code duplication is the root of all evil.
* Ask many questions.
* Ask open-ended questions.
* Critique your own idea first, and publicly.
* Every idea is valuable yet somehow terrible.

## Rules

* be civil and kind.
* ad hominem attacks will not be tolerated.
* no racism, sexism, homophobia, bigotry.
