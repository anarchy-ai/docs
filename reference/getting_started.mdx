## 👨‍💻 Installation

To install the LLM-VM you simply need to download this repository and install it with pip like so:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM.git
> cd LLM-VM
> pip3 install .
```

This will install both the library and test-server.  

### Generating Completions
Our LLM-VM gets you working directly with popular LLMs locally in just 3 lines. Once you've installed (as above), just load your model and start generating!


```python
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client

# Select which LLM you want to use, here we have openAI's 
client = Client(big_model = 'chat_gpt')

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(prompt = 'What is Anarchy?', context = '', openai_key = 'ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political ideology that advocates for the absence of government...
```

### Locally Run an LLM
```python
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client

# Select the LlaMA 2 model
client = Client(big_model = 'llama2')

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(prompt = 'What is Anarchy?', context = '')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political philosophy that advocates no government...
```
