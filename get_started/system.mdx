### Supported Models
Which model you choose to use will be the biggest impact on your system's requirements.

LLM-VM comes with support for some default models intended to get people experimenting with LLMs. You can see their specifications here.

We recommend making sure you have enough RAM to load the models.

Our section on [Local LLMs](quickstart/local_llms) has more information on specifying LLM models.
