## Installation
**Use git and pip to quickly install the LLM-VM**

### Get the code
You can download the code from our [Github](https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repo manually, or navigate a CLI to your preferred directory and run:
```bash CLI Install
git clone https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM.git
```

### Install the module
Once you've downloaded the code, getting it to work with Python is easy, open a CLI and
<CodeGroup>
```bash Standard Install
cd LLM-VM
pip3 install .
```
```bash Dev Install
cd LLM-VM
pip3 install --editable .
```
</CodeGroup>

This will install both the LLM-VM and the HTTP server.

<Note>Installing with the ```--editable``` flag allows your changes to the codebase to take effect without rebuilding with ```pip3 install .```</Note>
