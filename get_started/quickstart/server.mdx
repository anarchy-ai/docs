## LLM-VM Server
### Get up and running

All the functionality described in previous sections can be accessed almost entirely through an API call. First start the server with the following command.

```bash
llm_vm_server
```
This will spin up the flask server with settings specified in your ```settings.toml``` file!

### Specifying your models
**Save your development environment in a ```setting.toml``` file**
```toml
# Default settings for your application
BIG_MODEL = "chat_gpt"
PORT = 3002
SMALL_MODEL = "bloom"
HOST = "127.0.0.1"
```
The server pulls from this file to determine which LLMs will be used, allowing for reliable behavior every server launch.
