## Collecting Your Data

Data is the lifeblood of AI. Your organization likely has invaluable data that can be used to train AI models very specific to your domain:

## Preparing Your Dataset

It's essential to prepare your dataset cleanly and systematically. This ensures the quality and relevance of the data, leading to better model performance.

<Tip>This will be very important for preparing your data for augmentation, which will be outlined in the next section.</Tip>

The dataset needs to reflect the prompt-response nature of LLMs. So your dataset will need to have one ```system prompt```, then a series of ```prompts``` and ```responses``` that the LLM will use to hone itself. 

Structure them like this: 

| System Prompt                          | User Prompt                           | Response                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| Hi, how can I help you today?          |                                       | 
|                                        | What do these lab results suggest?                          | These lab results suggest that the patient is healthy, as no anomalous data has been detected. |
|                                        | What is the sentiment of the last 5 customers who came into support chat? | The last five customers have a neutral to positive sentiment. |
| | ... | ... |

### Collect

Ensure you have collected all relevant data from various sources within your organization. This includes databases, CRM systems, transaction logs, and more. 

### Clean

<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Duplicates" icon="text-slash">
    Ensure there are no duplicate entries in your dataset to avoid redundancy and bias.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Missing Values" icon="hammer">
    Identify and appropriately handle missing data points. Options include filling in missing values using statistical methods or removing incomplete records.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Correct Errors" icon="magnifying-glass-plus">
    Look for and correct any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data, such as typographical errors or misformatted entries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Normalize Data" icon="list-check">
    Standardize the format and scale of your data. This might involve converting all dates to a standard format, ensuring numerical values are on a consistent scale, and normalizing text data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Segment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Categorize Data" icon="tags">
    Segment your data into meaningful categories or classes. This helps in training models more effectively by ensuring relevant data is grouped together.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Selection" icon="filter">
    Identify and select the most relevant features for your model. This reduces noise and improves model performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Anonymize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Personal Identifiers" icon="user-slash">
    Ensure all personal or sensitive information is anonymized or removed to comply with privacy regulations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tokenization" icon="key">
    Replace sensitive data with tokens to maintain data integrity while protecting privacy. Store the mapping between tokens and the original sensitive data in a secure, separate location.
    <Info>
**PII Redaction Example:**
| Original Data           | Tokenized Data  |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| John Doe, 123-45-6789   | T123, T456      |
| Jane Smith, 987-65-4321 | T789, T654      |

In this example, "John Doe" is replaced with "T123" and "123-45-6789" with "T456," ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
</Info>
  </Step>

</Steps>


### Format

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consistent Structure" icon="align-center">
    Ensure all data follows a consistent structure and format, making it easier to process and analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Formats" icon="file">
    Convert data into appropriate file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) suitable for your training framework.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
For Anarchy's systems to be able to augment your data,  Data should be in csv format with three mandatory fields: ```system prompt```, ```prompt```, and ```completion```. Ensure that these fields are strictly followed in the order specified and without header row.

A properly formatted .csv dataset should look like this, without the header descriptions:

| System Prompt                          | User Prompt                           | Response                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| Hi, how can I help you today?          |                                       | 
|                                        | What do these lab results suggest?                          | These lab results suggest that the patient is healthy, as no anomalous data has been detected. |
|                                        | What is the sentiment of the last 5 customers who came into support chat? | The last five customers have a neutral to positive sentiment. |
| | ... | ... |
</Note>
