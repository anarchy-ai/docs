## Finetuning Models

<Warning>Before you continue, make sure you have a dataset prepared and a foundational model selected.</Warning>

Once you have a prepared dataset, you are ready to create a **new finetune job** on the Anarchy platform.

<Steps>
<Step title="Kickstart the Process">
From your dataset page, click on the ```+ New Finetune``` button at the top right corner of the screen. This will take you to the finetune job page.
</Step>
<Step title="Label Your Job">
Next, **name your finetune job**. Choose something unique that you can reference later.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Your Base Model">
Use the dropdown to choose your model.
<Tip>You can use previously finetuned models as a base model for further finetuning.</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust the Advanced Settings">
Tweak these settings to hone in your finetuning job even further.

  <Card title="Epochs" icon="clock">
    The number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learning Rate" icon="gauge-high">
    The step size used for updating the model's parameters during training.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch Size" icon="cubes">
    The number of training samples used in one iteration to update the model's parameters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Checkpoints" icon="timeline">
    Saving the model's state at regular intervals during training for later use or recovery.

</Steps>

## Cost and Credits

Finetuning is a relatively compute-intensive process, and the cost will scale with the **size of your dataset** and the number of **Epochs** you will train.

On the default Pay-as-you-go plan, 1 credit is equivalent to $1.00USD. For more information about pricing and volume discounts, contact us below or visit our [pricing page](/platform/build_your_own_llms/pricing).
