## Browse Open Models

On the 'AGIs' tab, you will see a grid of chatbots created in the open by the community.

Simply click on the bot you want to chat with, and you will be directed to a page where you can chat with them after signing into the application via Google or Github.

## Model Types

There are essentially two types of models available to chat with on Anarchy: foundation models, and finetuned models.

### Foundational Models

Foundational models are the backbone of the AI world, developed by leading researchers and companies using vast computational resources.
These models, such as GPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Llama (Meta), Mistral, and Mixtral are trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate human-like text.
Anarchy serves these foundational models 'out of the box' in their pure form without any additional training, providing users with powerful and versatile tools straight from the source without additional customization.

Use foundational models for tasks that require broad general knowledge, natural language processing, and a high degree of flexibility. Tasks like

### Finetuned Models

Finetuned models are tailored versions of foundational models, enhanced through additional training to specialize in specific tasks or domains. These models benefit from the foundational models' capabilities but are refined to excel in particular areas, making them highly efficient for targeted applications.

Finetuned models are perfect for:
