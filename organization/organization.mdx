We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support.

## 🥹 Our promises 🥹

* We will move towards open-source, not away from it.
* We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.
* We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).

## 💸 How will we make money? 💸

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.

# 🍼 Funding 🍼

We're a YC (W23) company, who's been funded by our wonderful investors: Fellows Fund, Amino Capital, Venrex, Futureland Ventures, 
Yash Tulsani, Timothy Chen, Arup Chakrabarti, Keith Sherry, Ahmed Medhat, and Jonathan Paulson.
