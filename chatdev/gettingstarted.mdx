## Usage Overview

<Info>This project is actively in development. If you encounter bugs, please report them on our discord.</Info>

## Firing up the chatbot

Initializing the chatbot is simple: when you're on a website, say ```https://anarchy.ai```, go into your URL bar and type ```chat.dev/``` in front of the base URL.

So your browser's URL bar would look like ```chat.dev/https://anarchy.ai```.

Hit enter, and a chatbot will read the page you selected and train a model on that website's publicly available data.

## Interacting with the Chatbot
Once you've initialized the chatbot as described, you'll be able to start chatting with it immediately. Here are the steps to interact effectively:

## Basic Commands
- Ask Questions: Simply type your question related to the website's content. For example, "What is the main product of Anarchy AI?"
- Retrieve Information: Request specific information such as contact details, product features, or company history.

<Card>
**Bot:**
Handling webhooks with Stripe involves the following steps:

1: Set up your endpoint to listen for webhook events.

2: Verify the webhook signature to ensure the request is from Stripe.

3: Handle the event type in your endpoint code.

Example code:

```Javascript: Javascript

const endpointSecret = 'your-webhook-secret';
const sig = request.headers['stripe-signature'];
let event;
try {
  event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, sig, endpointSecret);
} catch (err) {
  response.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
  return;
}
// Handle the event
if (event.type === 'payment_intent.succeeded') {
  const paymentIntent = event.data.object;
  // Fulfill the purchase...
}
response.status(200).json({ received: true });
```
